# -Solidity-Project-Create-a-Token
I made this Solidity contract defines a token named "META" with the abbreviation "MTA." It includes a public total supply and manages user balances through a mapping. The `mint` function increases the total supply and user balance, while the `burn` function decreases them, both with validation checks to ensure proper execution.
